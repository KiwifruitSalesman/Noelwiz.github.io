    <h2>What is this Game?</h2>
    <p>
      Yo are a traveling merchant on <a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/sindovanya-andevarlon-noelwiz/a/klocios-article">Klocios</a>, one of the
        conetnetns in my world. The core gameplay loop is traveling from city to city, buying/selling your stuff to make money, and then ubgrading.
