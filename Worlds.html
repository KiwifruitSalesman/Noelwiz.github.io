    <h2>Sindovanya Andevarlon</h2>
    <p>
      This world started because I read <a href="https://phys.org/news/2014-12-binary-terrestrial-planets.html">this article</a> about
      binary terrestrial planets, and if they could possibly occur. According to the article, there were some cases where they formed,
      but they had the interesting protperties of being tidally locked to eachother, which got me really excited to think about what it would
      be like if both planets were inhabited by intelegent life. The two planets are nessicarily close together, and because they're tidally locked
      would appear motionless in the sky if you were on the half of the planet that could see the other planet. The other planet would appear
      significantly larger and closer than the moon, and every day around noon, you would see the other planet eclpse any stars.
      <br>
      Needless to say, I had to do something with that, so I made <a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/sindovanya-andevarlon-noelwiz">Sindovanya Andevarlon</a>
      which has two planets that more or less fit that description. I've mostly focused on one, and it's infact where the game I'm working on,
      <a href="/Merchants_of_Klocios">Merchants_of_Klocios</a> is going to take place on. This was the first world I made on Worldanvil after helping
      with the Oriso, listed below, and one I've been enjoying developing.

		<h2>Bond108 - The Oriso</h2>
		<p>
      <a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/bond108-WesternAces/c/oriso-category">The Oriso</a> are a race of space faring
      anthropromorphic polar bears who primarily use solar sails for interstellar travel. Basically, they're solar polar bears.
      I've contributed most of the information about them, and am particularly proud of their language, and religon, which I hope
      to finish some day.
