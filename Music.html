		<h3>About?</h3>
		<p>
      I've composed some music for games as part of some game jams. Most of that was done in Musescore
      I haven't really taken any music theory classes, but I have played the trombone for about 12 years.
		</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Works</h3>
    <h3>Summer Horizon</h3>
    <p>
      I worked on this game, and hoped to have all the music recoreded by real people. I haven't uploaded the music yet,
      but you might be able to dig around the files and find it, or listen to it in <a href="https://aasd.itch.io/summer-horizon">game</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Beetman: Okrarina of Thyme</h4>
    <p>
      I was actually one of two composers on this game <a href="https://itch.io/jam/wwu-game-jam-s17/rate/135126">game</a>.
      Made in spring 2017 in RPG Maker, I wrote the music and then the other composer transformed it into what's actually in game.
      After this game, I started coding at the WWU quarterly game jams.

    <h4>String Theory OST</h4>
    <p>
      The orgional idea for this game was a bunch of minigames that you had to complete by hopping into portals
      to complete and unravel them so your spool of string doesn't completely run out of string. I also did the sound
      design for the game, which was an interesting second challenge trying to put sound to a soft yarn man.

    <h4>Plight of the Gerbal King OST</h4>
    <p>
      This was my first attempt at composing for games, as part of the WWU fall 2016 game jam, and honestly the music turned out
      not that good. I did the made the sound effects for the game as well which was fun. If you want to listen in context, find it <a href="https://echo-games.itch.io/plight-of-the-gerbil-king-gamejam">here</a>.

  <h4>Schlurbie OST</h4>
    <p>
      This music was me trying to practice composing a bit again. I'm taking video game programming about now (a week after the music was written),
      and I'm planning on composing origional music for that. I was inspired by one of the themes, and our setting: "Help I'm stuck in a Factory Factory".
      Something about factories reminded me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXVXPlzcVLI">Melodius Thunk</a> since I played the song in highschool with my highschool band
      and it does a fantasic job of building a wonderful song out of chaos, like a Factory Factory. Additionally I tried to make my music a little grunge like because factories aren't
      normally considered clean places, there's a lot of grating and unpleasent noise in my mind. Finally in the second track, I panned the audio a lot to
      create some effects of the sound moving around the listener and shifting. The game can be found on itch.io over <a href="https://joshkabo.itch.io/schlurbie">here</a>.
