		<h2>About?</h2>
		<p>
      I've composed some music for games as part of some game jams. Most of that was done in Musescore
      I haven't really taken any music theory classes, but I have played the trombone for about 12 years.
		</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Works</h2>
    <h3>Summer Horizon</h3>
    <p>
      I worked on this game, and hoped to have all the music recoreded by real people. I haven't uploaded the music yet,
      but you might be able to dig around the files and find it, or listen to it in <a href="https://aasd.itch.io/summer-horizon">game</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Beetman: Okrarina of Thyme</h3>
    <p>
      I was actually one of two composers on this game <a href="https://itch.io/jam/wwu-game-jam-s17/rate/135126">game</a>.
      Made in spring 2017 in RPG Maker, I wrote the music and then the other composer transformed it into what's actually in game.
      After this game, I started coding at the WWU quarterly game jams.

    <h3>String Theory OST</h3>
    <p>
      The orgional idea for this game was a bunch of minigames that you had to complete by hopping into portals
      to complete and unravel them so your spool of string doesn't completely run out of string. I also did the sound
      design for the game, which was an interesting second challenge trying to put sound to a soft yarn man.

    <br>
    <h3>Plight of the Gerbal King OST</h3>
    <p>
      This was my first attempt at composing for games, as part of the WWU fall 2016 game jam, and honestly the music turned out
      not that good. I did the made the sound effects for the game as well which was fun. If you want to listen in context, find it <a href="https://echo-games.itch.io/plight-of-the-gerbil-king-gamejam">here</a>.
