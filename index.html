    <h1> Hello </h1>
    <p> This is going to hopefully be a place to find out what I'm working on, either currently, or that I have on the back burrner.</p>

			Hello World

		<h2>Who am I?</h2>
		<p>
      I'm a human computer science studnent and an astronomy minor, which is cool.
      I hope to make video games eventually, so a lot of stuff here has to do with that, but I also am interested in percedual generation, so
      there's also some of that laying around in various states of completeness. Other than coding, I compose music occasionally, world build,
      and do a tiny bit of digital drawing.
