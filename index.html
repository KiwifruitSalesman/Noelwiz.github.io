    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <h3> Who Am I? </h3>
    <p> I'm Daniel, known as Noelwiz on the internet. I'm a programmer with a love of being creative. I make games, and small projects
      and always have a few things in progress. I expect to have a computer science degree in spring 2020, with a minor in astronomy.
      I'm interested in many things, but highlights include linguistics, procedural generation, game design and development, computer graphics,
      and telling stories. I love trying new things and starting projects.
    </p>

    <h3>What About Outside of CS? </h3>
    <p>
      Many things. I enjoy, linguistics, histroy, world building, music, and science. I watch a few pop science youtube channels, and podcasts
      because there's so many interesting thigns to learn. Though, world building really captures the heart of what I'm interested in: it's about
      learning how the world works and fits together and applying that creatively. I don't think anything really is isolated, and computer science
      is wonderful because it interacts with so many different fields and areas of knoledge.
    </p>

    <p>
      I play the trombone, and have since the fifth grade. In High School, I played with our marching band at two different
      Sea Hawks half time shows, one Victoria Day Parade in Victoria B.C., and I participate in my college's pep band. In Addition
      to playing music, I also picked up composing on my own and wrote for a few tiny game jam games. Unfortunately I never had
      a chance to take any music theory classes, but I still enjoy composing for fun.
    </p>

      This spring break I started playing with Unity's High Definition Render Pipeline to try and make something to experince Nvidia's
      RTX ray tracing. I wound up first playing around with a road and learning the volume framework. Then I started working on a little
      more polished of a scene. At the time of writing I'm getting started adapting a spline creator tool into a road generator that can
      work for larger levels and support intersections without having to hand place them and line up the splines and hand make the
      intersections every time.
