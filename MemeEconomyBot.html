      <h2> What is this? </h2>
      <p> Think of the economy. Now Imagine the stocks are memes, and that you trade them
      on discord. That is this bot (more or less)! </p>

      <h2>Current State</h2>
      <p>
        Currently the bot works, but there isn't much interactions between players. I hope to implment some way of allowing
        people to customize their memes, as wella s providing some basic sets for people. I also need to redesign the round system
        at some point, either actually going through and just making it time based, or figure out how to design it so people  are more
        willing to advance the round. After that point, I'll go back, fix the leader board, and other commands, and consider this bot done
        for now.
      </p>

      <h2> How do I use this? </h2>
        <h3>Instillation</h3>
          <p>
            <iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/218810?linkback=true&amp;bg_color=6aacc4&amp;fg_color=192BC2&amp;link_color=fa5c5c&amp;border_color=0E0E52" width="552" height="167"></iframe>
            <br>
            Download the files from Itch.io above. After that, compile them. Then, go do discord and create a bot user
            for the bot at <a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/">Discord's site</a>. Add the bot to
            your server, and create a text file in the folder you compiled the bot in called "bottoken.txt" and put your bot token
            from discord's site into the text file. Finally run the bot. Hopefully you can trouble shoot any errors.
          </p>
        <h3>Commands</h3>
        <p>
          All commands are triggered with $. If a meme's name has a space, it's tag must be used in any commands. <br>

        <h2>Other Info</h2>
        <p>I'd like to finish this bot since it doesn't feel too far from actually complete, which would be a first it feels like, for something
        such a big project, but I'm not sure when my ADHD and free time will line up to let me finish this.
