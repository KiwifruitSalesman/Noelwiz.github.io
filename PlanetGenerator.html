    <h1> What? </h1>
    <p> The idea is that it will be able to generate planets, and stars, giving you their mass, radius, density, stuff like that.
    Additionally, I'm hoping to allow people to make some special planets or planetiary systems, like specifically generate a star with
  a habitable planet, or with a gas gient orbiting close to the star.</p>

		<h2>Current State</h2>
		<p>
      Currently the project is in it's early stages. Mostly Python skeletons, and planning is done. Most of the different classes for
      objects have fields, and some functions to calulate basic properties, but there's not yet any actual generation working, nor is
      that information convayed to users yet.
		</p>

    <h2>Other Info</h2>
    <p>Currently this project isn't a very high priority for me, so it may be a long time before it's in any useable state, but if anyone is
      really interested in it, tweet me or something and I'll be happy to talk about it.
    </p>
