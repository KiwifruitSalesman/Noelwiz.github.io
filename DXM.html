      <h3> What is this? </h3>
      <p>
        Think of tetris, now imagine what it would be like if gravity rotated periodically, and the blocks were only 3 squares.
      </p>

      <h3>Current State</h3>
      <p>
        Currently the game is not exactly playable. It's still in the same state as it was at the end of the game jam. You can
        manipulate gravity, move blocks and the blocks will move periodically, but that's about it. The biggest problem is with
        collision, and the grid.
      </p>

      <h3>Other Info</h3>
      <p>
        I think both me and Vae I worked with want to fix and get this game to a playable state in the future. I did the
        coding, while Vae  did the music and art for the game.
      </p>

      <h3> How do I use this? </h3>
        <h4>Instillation</h4>
          <p>
            <iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/376902?linkback=true&amp;bg_color=a4d2e7&amp;border_color=0E0E52" width="552" height="167"></iframe>
            <br>
            Download the files from Itch.io above. After that, you should be able to run the game and see how it doesn't really work that well.
          </p>
        <h4>Controlls</h4>
        <p>
          All commands are triggered with $. If a meme's name has a space, it's tag must be used in any commands.
          Time advances every time you move, or after a second. Gravity rotates after about 5 blocks are placed, although the blocks currently
          don't fall down to match gravity.
