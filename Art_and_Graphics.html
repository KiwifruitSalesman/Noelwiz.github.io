		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<p>
      <h4>Snowshoe</h4><br>
      <img src="./Images/snowshoe Obtained.PNG" alt="A pixel art image of a showshoe. It is mostly black." width="50" height="50">
      <br>
      This was made as a placeholder for June Gloom Peak, the game I'm working on in Video Game Programming this quarter (fall 2019). It's supposed to be a snowshoe,
      and I think it actually looks pretty good
      <br>
       <h4>Flag and Shield</h4> <br>
       <img src="./Images/flag 1.png" alt="A tricolor flag, the top stripe is light green, middle is light blue, bottom is dark green. In the middle is a medium green circle
       with 3 dark grey lines, the middle one is bigger than the outer two lines." width="160" height="128">

       <img src="./Images/shield 1.png" alt="a low resolution kite shield, at the top is a light green stripe, then there is a light blue stripe. In the middle is another
       light green circle with 3 grey bars. The middle bar is slightly taller than the outer two. At the bottom of a shiled is a dark green stripe."
       width="64" height="64">
      <br>
       This shield and flag are from <a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/sindovanya-andevarlon-noelwiz">one of the fictional worlds</a> I'm working on
       I think specifically these were going to be for the Defenders of the Library, a military organization, but apparently they were for something else
       or just haven't been used yet.
